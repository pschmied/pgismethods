  Abstract =     {Driven by the rise of Web 2.0 and the non-stop
                  spread of mobile device sensors, the concept of
                  Public Participation GIS (PPGIS) is knowing a
                  revolutionary era which perfectly fits the new
                  vision of Digital Earth (DE). This research
                  investigates the opportunity to build up a PPGIS
                  prototype with completely Free and Open Source
                  Software (FOSS) architecture, in which data directly
                  come from field surveys carried out by users. A
                  sample application related to urban monitoring is
                  addressed, which concentrates on user
                  field-collected data concerning reports of road
                  pavement damages. Open Data Kit suite allows users
                  to collect geotagged multimedia information using
                  mobile devices with onboard location sensors (e.g. a
                  Global Positioning System receiver). On
                  field-captured data are sent to a server and stored
                  into a PostgreSQL database with PostGIS spatial
                  extension. GeoServer then disseminates data on the
                  Web. On the client-side, different solutions allow
                  data visualization on both desktop computers and
                  mobile devices. The designed architecture provided
                  support for FOSS usage in the process of gathering,
                  uploading, and Web publishing information collected
                  in situ.  The implementation of the developed PPGIS
                  could thus substantially increase public active
                  participation in data creation and sharing, besides
                  enlarging DE knowledge up to the local level.},

                  have become increasingly equipped with
                  single-frequency global positioning system (GPS)
                  receivers or loggers. These commonly used terminals
                  offer an inexpensive way for acquiring large volumes
                  of GPS traces, which contain information pertaining
                  to road position and traffic rules. Using this new
                  type of spatial data resource, we propose a novel
                  approach for generating high-quality routable road
                  maps. In this approach, a simplified road network
                  graph model uses circular boundaries to separate all
                  GPS traces into road intersections and road segments
                  and builds road networks that maintain their
                  identical geometric topologies through the
                  entry/exit points at the original boundaries. One
                  difficulty inherent to this type of approach is how
                  to best determine the appropriate spatial coverage
                  for road intersections. Conflict points among GPS
                  traces that have large intersection angles usually
                  occur within the physical areas of road
                  intersections, particularly those involving left
                  turns.  Therefore, we determined a proper circle
                  boundary for individual road intersections by
                  conducting a spatial analysis of such feature
                  points.  This approach was implemented using Python
                  and PostgreSQL/PostGIS and was tested in Huaibei
                  City, China. Based on a comparison with
                  human-interpreted results, the automatically
                  generated routable road map was demonstrated to be
                  of high quality and displayed detailed road networks
                  with turning at various at-grade intersections,
                  interchanges and U-turns.},

                  pattern mining.  Considering a set of boolean
                  spatial features, the goal is to find subsets of
                  features frequently located together. It has wide
                  applications in environmental management, public
                  safety, transportation or tourism. These last years,
                  many algorithms have been proposed to extract
                  frequent co-locations. However, most solutions do a
                  ``data-centered knowledge discovery'' instead of a
                  ``expert-centered knowledge
                  discovery''. Successfully providing useful and
                  interpretable patterns to experts is still an open
                  problem. In this setting, we propose a domain-driven
                  co-location mining approach that combines
                  constraint-based mining and cartographic
                  visualization. Experts can push new domain
                  constraints into the mining algorithm, resulting in
                  more relevant patterns and more efficient
                  extraction. Then, they can visualize solutions using
                  a new concise and intuitive cartographic
                  visualization of co-locations. Using this original
                  visualization approach, they identify new
                  interesting patterns, and use uninteresting ones to
                  define new constraints and refine their
                  analysis. These proposals have been integrated into
                  a prototype based on PostGIS geographic information
                  system. Experiments have been done using a real
                  geological datasets studying soil erosion, and
                  results have been validated by a domain expert.},

                  affecting the delay between data collection and
                  dissemination in archaeology. In this paper, we
                  outline the fundamental methodology of ArchField, an
                  integrated digital field recording solution
                  developed to overcome this bottleneck and translate
                  field excavations to virtual museums in
                  real-time. ArchField records sub-centimetre accurate
                  three-dimensional coordinates from Total Stations
                  and RTK GPS units. Recorded field data and measured
                  3D coordinates are digitally processed to produce
                  auto-generated daily GIS top plans. The processing
                  pipeline enables the generation of publishable
                  online maps from the first day of excavation to the
                  last. It is interoperable with many different GIS
                  viewers and stores data in an online PostGIS
                  database. Digitization of archaeological data in the
                  field is streamlined to facilitate standardization,
                  redundancy and storage that can be immediately made
                  accessible online to the digital
                  community. Consequently, ArchField integrates
                  features such as synchronization, data formatting,
                  re-projection, dynamic labeling and
                  symbolization. It provides immediate online
                  accessibility of field excavations for virtual
                  museums of the future. ArchField enables any
                  archaeological project to inexpensively adopt

                  (NA2RE: http://na2re.ismai.pt) as a chorological
                  database system. Initially designed to be a system
                  of distributed databases, NA2RE quickly evolved to a
                  Spatial Data Infrastructure, a system of
                  geographically distributed systems. Each individual
                  system has a national focus and is implemented in an
                  online network, accessible through standard
                  interfaces, thus allowing for interoperable
                  communication and sharing of spatial-temporal data
                  amongst one another.  A Web interface facilitates
                  the access of the user to all participating data
                  systems as if it were one single virtual integrated
                  data-source.  Upon user request, the Web interface
                  searches all distributed data-sources for the
                  requested data, integrating the answers in an always
                  updated and interactive map. This infrastructure
                  implements methods for fast actualisation of
                  national observation records, as well as for the use
                  of a common taxonomy and systematics. Using this
                  approach, data duplication is avoided, national
                  systems are maintained in their own countries, and
                  national organisations are responsible for their own
                  data curation and management. The database could be
                  built with different representation levels and
                  resolution levels of data, and filtered according to
                  species conservation matters. We present the first

                  developed using several programming languages (PhP,
                  Ajax, JavaScript, Java), libraries (OpenLayers,
                  JQuery) and open source software components
                  (GeoServer, PostgreSQL, PostGIS). The presented web
                  application has several main advantages: it is
                  available all the time, it is accessible from
                  everywhere, it creates a real time multi-user
                  collaboration platform, the programing languages
                  code and components are interoperable and designed
                  to work in a distributed computer environment, it is
                  flexible for adding additional components and
                  services and, it is scalable depending on the
                  workload. The application was successfully tested on
                  a case study with concurrent multi-users access.},

                  problems to be detected, solutions to be developed
                  and the effectiveness of actions to be
                  assessed. However, the remoteness of many sites or a
                  lack of resources means these data are frequently
                  not available. Remote sensing may provide a
                  solution, but large-scale mapping and change
                  detection may not be appropriate, necessitating
                  site-level assessments. These need to be easy to
                  undertake, rapid and cheap. We present an example of
                  a Web-based solution based on free and open-source
                  software and standards (including PostGIS,
                  OpenLayers, Web Map Services, Web Feature Services
                  and GeoServer) to support assessments of land-cover
                  change (and validation of global land-cover maps).
                  Authorised users are provided with means to assess
                  land-cover visually and may optionally provide
                  uncertainty information at various levels: from a
                  general rating of their confidence in an assessment
                  to a quantification of the proportions of land-cover
                  types within a reference area. Versions of this tool
                  have been developed for the TREES-3 initiative
                  (Simonetti et al., 2011). This monitors tropical
                  land-cover change through ground-truthing at
                  latitude/longitude degree confluence points, and for
                  monitoring of change within and around Important
                  Bird Areas (IBAs) by Birdlife International and the
                  Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB). In
                  this paper we present results from the second of
                  these applications. We also present further details
                  on the potential use of the land-cover change

                  used to increase the usability of Earth observation
                  data by local stakeholders and experts, and assist

  Abstract =     {Combining emission inventory methods and geographic
                  information systems (GIS) remains a key issue for
                  environmental modelling and management
                  purposes. This paper examines the development of a
                  web GIS application as part of an emission inventory
                  system that produces maps and files with spatial
                  allocated emissions in a grid format. The study is
                  not confined in the maps produced but also presents
                  the features and capabilities of a web application
                  that can be used by every user even without any
                  prior knowledge of the GIS field. The development of
                  the application was based on open source software
                  tools such as MapServer for the GIS functions,
                  PostgreSQL and PostGIS for the data management and
                  HTML, PHP and JavaScript as programming
                  languages. In addition, background processes are
                  used in an innovative manner to handle the time
                  consuming and computational costly procedures of the
                  application.  Furthermore, a web map service was
                  created to provide maps to other clients such as the
                  Google Maps API v3 that is used as part of the user
                  interface. The output of the application includes
                  maps in vector and raster format, maps with temporal
                  resolution on daily and hourly basis, grid files
                  that can be used by air quality management systems
                  and grid files consistent with the European
                  Monitoring and Evaluation Programme Grid. Although
                  the system was developed and validated for the
                  Republic of Cyprus covering a remarkable wide range
                  of pollutant and emissions sources, it can be easily
                  customized for use in other countries or smaller
                  areas, as long as geospatial and activity data are

                  updated in short time frames and exchanged
                  frequently over the Web, the demand for updating
                  dataset and metadata in real time to provide users
                  with the most up-to-date, precise, reliable, and
                  complete metadata is increasing dramatically. So
                  far, different metadata-updating approaches have
                  been introduced to the spatial industry of which
                  their issues and challenges have prohibited them
                  from being adopted widely. Using the detached
                  metadata data model and being limited to some
                  dataset formats are some of these issues. To respond
                  to this challenge, this article presents a new
                  synchronization approach to automatically update the
                  ISO 19115 core metadata elements which are affected
                  by the (vector-based) dataset modification. Based on
                  this approach, this article describes the major
                  technical requirements considered necessary for the
                  implementation phase, such as an integrated data
                  model to couple dataset and metadata rooted in
                  Geography Markup Language (GML) Application Schema,
                  a mapping software application to support required
                  Web Services, a user-friendly interface providing a
                  visual modification facility, and an automatic
                  metadata-updating process which is dataset format
                  neutral. In order to prove the synchronization
                  concept, the automatic synchronization approach has
                  been prototyped and integrated with the GeoNetwork
                  opensource environment. This article discusses the
                  architecture designed for implementing the prototype
                  system which contains three layers: storage, service
                  (consisting of a synchronization service entitled
                  SYNC'), and application. The standards and open
                  source technologies selected to develop the
                  prototype system such as deegree, GeoNetwork,
                  PostGIS, GML, Web Feature Service-Transaction, and
                  CSW are then explained in more detail. Finally, the
                  issues and challenges encountered during the
                  implementation phase and the future direction are
                  discussed in this article.},

                  prohibit the development of a deterministic model of
                  water quality. The causes of known water quality
                  anomalies can however be investigated through mining
                  the large volumes of water quality, hydraulic and
                  asset data currently being collected by utility
                  companies.  The data-driven methodology described
                  here permits historical cause-effect linkages to be
                  identified in a scalable, largely automatable
                  fashion. Under Distribution System Integrated
                  Modelling (DSIM), spatio-temporal searches within
                  the set of pipes that typically lie upstream of a
                  known water quality anomaly are used to identify
                  possible causes. Understanding of the flow paths
                  that connect causes and effects are derived from the
                  results of hydraulic network simulations.  DSIM was
                  used to investigate contacts regarding
                  discolouration and smell/taste issues from customers
                  within a Water Supply Zone in England, UK, over a
                  six-year period. 17.6\% of discolouration issues and
                  17.4\% of smell/taste issues were linked to
                  maintenance jobs using the methodology, much smaller
                  proportions than were identified using radial cause
                  searches. The DSIM search results contained a
                  greater proportion of one-to-one linkages and so are
                  less ambiguous than the results of the radial
                  spatio-temporal searches. DSIM was found to be a
                  useful and informative tool for data mining multiple

  Abstract =     {Objective: The aim of this paper was to show that
                  easily interpretable maps of local and national
                  prescribing data, available from open sources, can
                  be used to demonstrate meaningful variations in
                  prescribing performance.  Design: The prescription
                  dispensing data from the National Health Service
                  (NHS) Information Centre for the medications
                  metformin hydrochloride and methylphenidate were
                  compared with reported incidence data for the
                  conditions, diabetes and attention deficit
                  hyperactivity disorder, respectively. The incidence
                  data were obtained from the open source general
                  practitioner (GP) Quality and Outcomes
                  Framework. These data were mapped using the Ordnance
                  Survey CodePoint Open data and the data tables
                  stored in a PostGIS spatial database. Continuous
                  maps of spending per person in England were then
                  computed by using a smoothing algorithm and areas
                  whose local spending is substantially (at least
                  fourfold) and significantly (p<0.05) higher than the
                  national average are then highlighted on the maps.
                  Setting: NHS data with analysis of primary care
                  prescribing.  Population: England, UK.  Results: The
                  spatial mapping demonstrates that several areas in
                  England have substantially and significantly higher
                  spending per person on metformin and
                  methyphenidate. North Kent and the Wirral have
                  substantially and significantly higher spending per
                  child on methyphenidate.  Conclusions: It is
                  possible, using open source data, to use statistical
                  methods to distinguish chance fluctuations in
                  prescribing from genuine differences in prescribing
                  rates. The results can be interactively mapped at a
                  fine spatial resolution down to individual GP
                  practices in England. This process could be
                  automated and reported in real time. This can inform
                  decision-making and could enable earlier detection
                  of emergent phenomena.},

  Abstract =     {Applications for atmospheric pollution monitoring
                  and modelling are fundamental tools to develop
                  environmental policies oriented to control and
                  possibly reduce the impact of pollution on
                  ecosystems and human health. However, differences
                  among monitoring systems and data availability are
                  an important limitation in environmental
                  management. In order to standardize protocols and
                  procedures, the EU directives (e.g., INSPIRE, Air
                  Quality Directive) and international programs (i.e.,
                  GEOSS) have oriented the community towards
                  developing interoperable standardized systems that
                  assure real time data analysis and dissemination. To
                  coordinate national earth and cross-disciplinary
                  systems for promoting GEOSS and to support the
                  INSPIRE implementation, the GIIDA (Integrated and
                  Interoperable Management of Environmental Data)
                  project was launched. Within GIIDA the working group
                  on air quality was instructed to develop an
                  interoperable system for air quality information
                  management. The system is based on open-source tools
                  compliant with standards and designed to develop a
                  Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI), which will
                  contain information collected at ground-based as
                  well as at off-shore monitoring sites. This
                  infrastructure aims to store, mine and visualize
                  information. The SDI will support modelling
                  activities and environmental assessments for
                  different scenarios in order to evaluate the impact
                  of atmospheric pollution ecosystems and human
                  health. In this paper we discuss the application of
                  the IT framework and methodologies for the SDI
                  development, which was built on open-source
                  components: Postgis for data storage, Geoserver to
                  export services and GeoNetwork for metadata
                  generation. Finally, we describe the ICT pluggable
                  framework GeoInt, which was developed to simplify
                  the SDI component's complexity for end users by
                  supporting data input from different sources, as
                  well as metadata management.},

  Abstract =     {Currently, the use of a mix of renewable and
                  traditional energy sources is deemed to help in
                  solving increasing energy demands and environmental
                  issues, thus making it particularly important to
                  assess the availability of renewable energy sources.
                  In a heavily forested region, such as the Italian
                  Alps, one of the main renewable energy sources is
                  woody biomass.  A reliable evaluation of biomass
                  availability must take into account the local
                  management of forest resources and the ability to
                  reach forest areas, which is related to existing
                  road networks, and the characteristics and
                  morphology of the terrain.  We have developed a new
                  methodology to estimate forest biomass availability
                  for energy production in the Alpine area and to
                  support management decisions, combining the
                  morphological features of the mountain landscape
                  with the current capabilities of forest technology.
                  The approach has been implemented in a tool for
                  forest biomass evaluation based on the Free and Open
                  Source Software for Geospatial (FOSS4G) framework
                  and to refine the current estimates made by the
                  local government.  The methodology was tested on the
                  forests of Trentino province (Italy), providing an
                  accurate evaluation of biomass availability, which
                  can be effectively used to identify possible
                  locations for biomass power plants and to suggest
                  new forest management guidelines.  The methodology,
                  combining GRASS, PostgreSQL and PostGIS, can be
                  applied to a wide area and can also be executed as a
                  new GRASS module. Being open source it is already
                  available for testing and development.},

                  Spatial Databases, forms a key part of the
                  curriculum on these courses. Interest in Spatial
                  Databases is, however, more widespread especially
                  with the increasing understanding of the relevance
                  of geospatial techniques to fields as diverse as
                  anthropology and architecture. This article
                  describes the development and evaluation of a

                  vital role in promoting human health and protecting
                  the environment. Local, state, and federal partners
                  must collaborate to strategically plan initiatives,
                  allocate resources, and evaluate emergency response
                  activities. These collaborative decision-making
                  processes can be improved by using web-based mapping
                  applications for visualization and analysis. We
                  developed a web-based GIS framework which is applied
                  to public health data for North Carolina's (NC)
                  Department of Health and Human Services. The
                  application visualizes all state-regulated food
                  service facilities and supports query and analysis
                  tools crucial for food recalls or radiation
                  contamination tracking.  Built with
                  PostgreSQL/PostGIS, GeoServer, and a customized
                  GeoExplorer map viewer, the framework delivers a
                  web-based mapping tool that is flexible and Open
                  Source. The flexibility of the framework is an
                  important dimension of its scalability, allowing it
                  to be customizable, modular, and portable so that it
                  is easily configurable to support additional
                  research and education initiatives. This approach
                  reverses a trend toward application-specific web
                  mapping development in Open Source GIS. To
                  demonstrate flexibility, we configured an additional
                  website for forest landowner management to be used
                  by another state agency, the NC Forest Service.},

                  aggregate disparate datasets enables more meaningful

                  of Marine Life served as the catalyst for such a
                  global data aggregation effort. Under the Census
                  framework, the Ocean Biogeographic Information
                  System was established to coordinate an
                  unprecedented aggregation of global marine
                  biogeography data. The OBIS data system now contains
                  31.3 million observations, freely accessible through
                  a geospatial portal. The challenges of storing,
                  querying, disseminating, and mapping a global data
                  collection of this complexity and magnitude are
                  significant. In the face of declining performance
                  and expanding feature requests, a redevelopment of
                  the OBIS data system was undertaken. Following an
                  Open Source philosophy, the OBIS technology stack
                  was rebuilt using PostgreSQL, PostGIS, GeoServer and
                  OpenLayers.  This approach has markedly improved the
                  performance and online user experience while
                  maintaining a standards-compliant and interoperable
                  framework. Due to the distributed nature of the
                  project and increasing needs for storage,
                  scalability and deployment flexibility, the entire
                  hardware and software stack was built on a Cloud
                  Computing environment.  The flexibility of the
                  platform, combined with the power of the application
                  stack, enabled rapid re-development of the OBIS

                  standards-compliance.},

                  hazards in urban environments such as construction
                  barricades, temporary fencing across walkways, and
                  obstacles along curbs. These hazards present a
                  problem for navigation, because they typically
                  appear in an unplanned manner and are seldom
                  included in databases used for accessibility
                  mapping. Tactile maps are a traditional tool used by
                  blind and vision-impaired people for navigation
                  through urban environments, but such maps are not
                  automatically updated with transitory hazards. As an
                  alternative approach to static content on tactile
                  maps, we use volunteered geographic information
                  (VGI) and an Open Source system to provide updates
                  of local infrastructure. These VGI updates,
                  contributed via voice, text message, and e-mail, use
                  geographic descriptions containing place names to
                  describe changes to the local environment. After
                  they have been contributed and stored in a database,
                  we georeference VGI updates with a detailed
                  gazetteer of local place names including buildings,
                  administrative offices, landmarks, roadways, and
                  dormitories. We publish maps and alerts showing
                  transitory hazards, including location-based alerts

                  database, and PostGIS, the PostgreSQL's spatial

                  integration of user-contributed geospatial
                  information into a comprehensive system for use by

  Abstract =     {This paper presents a new approach to forming a
                  foundation of the ISO 19115 metadata automation. The
                  proposed approach is based on an integrated data
                  model to store spatial metadata along with its
                  related dataset which enables the metadata to be
                  updated automatically and concurrently with any
                  change in the dataset. The paper proposes an
                  architecture for implementing this new approach
                  based on a PostgreSQL/PostGIS database, deegree
                  WFS-T server, and GML Application Schema as well as
                  a graphical user interface. This approach allows the
                  users to generate the metadata elements in parallel
                  with the spatial dataset lifecycle (data collection,
                  dataset creation, storage, publishing, discovery,
                  access and retrieval, utilisation, maintenance, and
                  planning and policy making) in an automated fashion
                  where feasible.  This has the potential to overcome
                  the issues raised by the current metadata generation
                  and updating approach which is rooted in a single

  Abstract =     {Jaspa (Java Spatial) is a novel spatial extension
                  for relational database management systems
                  (RDBMSs). It is the result of a research project
                  that aims to accomplish two goals: firstly, to fill
                  the absence in the Free and Open Source Software
                  (FOSS) world of a solid Java-based alternative to
                  PostGIS, the leading spatial extension written in C.
                  Secondly, to exploit the advantages of Java and the
                  Java geospatial libraries over C in terms of
                  portability and easiness to extend. Java programming
                  for geospatial purposes is a flowering field and
                  similar solutions to Jaspa have recently appeared,
                  but none of them can equate with PostGIS due to lack
                  of functionalities. Jaspa currently implements
                  almost all PostGIS functionality. The next step will
                  be the enrichment of the software with more
                  sophisticated features: storage of spatial data in a
                  topological structure within the RDBMS, cluster
                  tolerance and geodetic functionalities. Jaspa is
                  being developed at the Department of Cartographic
                  Engineering. Geodesy and Photogrammetry of the

                  from many sources, such as GPS devices and mobile
                  phones, as sequences of spatio-temporal
                  points. These data can be used in many application
                  domains such as traffic management, urban planning,
                  tourism, bird migration, and so on.  Raw trajectory
                  data, as generated by mobile devices have very
                  little or no semantics, and in most applications a
                  higher level of abstraction is needed to exploit
                  these data for decision making. Although several
                  different methods have been proposed so far for
                  trajectory querying and mining, there are no
                  software tools to help the end user with semantic
                  trajectory data analysis. In this article we present
                  a software architecture for semantic trajectory data
                  mining as well as the first software prototype to
                  enrich trajectory data with both semantic
                  information and data mining. As a prototype we
                  extend the Weka data mining toolkit with the module
                  Weka-STPM, which is interoperable with databases

                  0749-0208 The Macau area, in Rio Grande do Norte
                  State, Brazil, is characterized by onshore and
                  offshore oil exploration, salt companies, shrimp
                  farms and fishery. These activities are in an area
                  with intense influence of high energy coastal
                  processes, causing the morphologic instability. It's
                  important a study of environmental characterization
                  in the identification of areas for protection and
                  recovery. The Spatio-Temporal Database (STD) stores
                  the descriptive, geographical and historical data.
                  In environmental monitoring of coastal systems, the
                  STD is used in the analysis, monitoring and
                  prevention of possible events with damage that can
                  happen. The fact of store the historical and
                  geographical data of an area in a database allows
                  evaluating the temporal changes, the natural
                  reactions, the evolution process of that area, the
                  main events, simply when accessing that historical
                  base of data. The main objective of that work is to
                  develop a STD with geographical and historical data
                  of the Macau area. To develop this database it was
                  done a conceptual model using the GeoFrame-T
                  model. The database manager system used was the
                  POSTGRESQL and your spatial extension POSTGIS. The
                  technologies used were MapServer (to display
                  geographical data), the web server Apache and the
                  programming language PHP.}

                  Resources (WRB). Soil maps are among the most
                  important reference maps in environmental and
                  agriculture fields.  Determination of land,
                  agricultural potential, erosion thread, land
                  management or soil pollution are some topics that
                  need spatial soil data. Attention to cross-border
                  environmental matters, such as soil protection, has
                  become an international concern that requires
                  harmonized soil information. This is why the World
                  Reference Base for Soil Resources has been selected
                  by European Union as official soil classification
                  system (IUSS Working Group WRB, 2007). Belgium is
                  one of the first nations to have achieved the whole
                  country soil survey at large scale (1:20,000). The
                  legend of the soil map of Belgium is based on three
                  or four main soil specifications, texture, drainage
                  class, profile development and stoniness nature (for
                  stony soil), each one represented by a letter. Those
                  three or four letters all together form the main
                  soil series. Prefix and suffix may be added to
                  further detail it. The WRB system based on soil
                  morphology is formed of two levels, 32 Reference
                  Soil Groups (RSGs), and various qualifiers (prefix,
                  suffix or both). A common methodology between
                  Flanders, Luxembourg and Wallonia (that use the same
                  soil map legend) is requested to carry out the
                  translation. Data from different databases, digital
                  soil maps, soil profile descriptions, soil
                  analytical data, Digital Elevation Model, other
                  thematic maps (e.g. flooding hazard areas) are
                  collected and organized under a common PostgreSQL
                  database {[}Belgian Soil Profile Database (BSP)],
                  with PostGIS geographical extension, hosted under a
                  dedicated server. Data validation is proposed to be
                  done under the auspices of National Soil Committee
                  of Royal Academy for Sciences and Arts of
                  Belgium. Algorithms are implemented in Perl and R

                  information currently available. The complex
                  structure of these databases, intensive use of codes

                  non-specialists to utilize digital soil survey
                  resources. A project was initiated to construct a
                  web-based interface to digital soil survey products
                  (STATSGO and SSURGO) for California, Arizona, and
                  Nevada that would be accessible to the general
                  public. A collection of mature, open source
                  applications (including Mapserver, PostGIS and
                  Apache Web Server) were used as a framework to
                  support data storage, querying, map composition,
                  data presentation, and contextual links to related
                  materials. Application logic was written in the PHP
                  language to ``glue'' together the many components of
                  an online soil survey. A comprehensive website
                  (http://casoilresource.lawr.ucdavis.edu/ map) was
                  created to facilitate access to digital soil survey
                  databases through several interfaces including:
                  interactive map, Google Earth and HTTP-based
                  application programming interface (API). Each soil
                  polygon is linked to a map unit summary page, which
                  includes links to soil component summary pages. The
                  most commonly used soil properties, land
                  interpretations and ratings are presented. Graphical
                  and tabular summaries of soil profile information
                  are dynamically created, and aid with rapid
                  assessment of key soil properties. Quick links to
                  official series descriptions (OSD) and other such
                  information are presented. All terminology is linked
                  back to the USDA-NRCS Soil Survey Handbook which
                  contains extended definitions. The Google Earth
                  interface to Soil-Web can be used to explore soils
                  information in three dimensions. A flexible web API
                  was implemented to allow advanced users of soils
                  information to access our website via simple web
                  page requests. Soil-Web has been successfully used
                  in soil science curriculum, outreach activities, and
                  current research projects.  Although not the only
                  online soil survey application, Soil-Web remains the

                  widely used in Geographic Information System (GIS)
                  through spatial database systems. In simple feature
                  models (lacking of persistent topology) executing
                  some common spatial operations requires a high
                  amount of system resources. Such common operations
                  occur for example in the `OpenGIS Simple Features
                  for SQL' protocol (SFS), a client-server
                  interoperability standard defined by `The Open
                  Geospatial Consortium, Inc.' (OGC). The specific
                  spatial operation studied in this paper is called
                  `dissolve'. It is carried out using the union
                  spatial operator defined by OGC and consists of
                  removing the boundaries between adjacent
                  polygons. The proposed algorithm improves
                  substantially the performance of this spatial
                  operation and it needs between 100 and 1000 times
                  less amount of resources. This way it enables the
                  database server to carry out this spatial operation
                  on huge datasets containing up to millions of
                  geometries. To check and to validate this algorithm

  Abstract =     {The Northern coast of Rio Grande do Norte (RN) State
                  is characterized by an intense coastal dynamics
                  compared to other Brazilian coastal regions.  In
                  this area are installed the main socioeconomic
                  activities of the RN State (the oil industry, salt
                  companies and shrimp farms). The oil industry is the
                  most affected by this dynamic that causes strong
                  erosion on the shore and exposure of wells and
                  pipelines installed along of the beach. This feature
                  justifies the integration of multidisciplinary and
                  detailed scientific studies to evaluate the
                  evolution of the coastal environment. The main
                  objective of this work is to develop an intelligent

                  Geographic Database with spatial data of the study
                  area. Furthermore, the OpenSource technologies were
                  included in the development of a Web system like:
                  GeoServer as framework of the view; PostgreSQL as
                  DataBase Management System; PostGIS spatial

                  using a client-server architecture. It makes use of
                  two open-source GIS tools, PostGIS (as the system
                  database) and GeoServer (to connect the database to
                  the client mapping application).  The client mapping
                  application has been built in Macromedia Flash. The

  Abstract =     {The Southeast Atlantic Coastal Ocean Observing
                  System (SEACOOS) established a comprehensive
                  information management (IM) system, comprising a
                  distributed hardware and software applications
                  infrastructure that enabled access to and processing
                  of complex databases from multiple sites. Initial
                  focus was on the development of a set of standards
                  for data transport mechanisms, vocabulary, and
                  metadata. Data were organized in a relational
                  database structure, and new developments addressed
                  identified needs, such as more rapid aggregation and
                  posting of near-real-time data. For presentation of
                  data, map-based products were developed, including
                  both pre-generated, ``report-based'' maps and
                  interactive maps generated by users at their
                  browsers. Map development was based on parallel
                  developments in database structure, data standards,
                  and data transport mechanisms that enabled
                  aggregation and normalization of distributed
                  data. The open source MapServer application was used
                  along with PostgreSQL and its extension PostGIS, as
                  the basic mapping tool. A data animation
                  presentation platform was created that combined maps
                  and graphs with the capacity to select GIS layers,
                  scale, types of observation to graph, and time
                  steps.  Quality Assurance/Quality Control (QA/QC)
                  issues were also addressed, with developments in
                  automated testing of data and filtering and flagging
                  systems. A primary concern of the IM system was to
                  support the path towards interoperability among
                  national and international ocean observing system
                  elements. Included are ``lessons learned'' that
                  promote the efficiency and stability of regional
                  systems, such as the need for appropriate redundancy
                  and a focus on region-specific applications that
                  demonstrate value in the relatively near term.}

  Abstract =     {Our ability to inform conservation and management of
                  species is fundamentally limited by the availability
                  of relevant biogeographic data, use of statistically
                  robust predictive models, and presentation of
                  results to decision makers. Despite the ubiquity of
                  presence-only models, where available, survey effort
                  should be included in the modeling process to limit
                  spatial bias. The biogeographic archive therefore
                  should be able to store and serve related spatial
                  information such as lines of survey effort or
                  polygons of the study area, best accomplished
                  through geospatial web services such as the Open
                  Geospatial Consortium (OGC) Web Feature Service
                  (WFS). ideally data could then be easily fetched by
                  modelers into a scientific workflow, providing a
                  visually intuitive, modular, reusable canvas for
                  linking analytical processes without the need to
                  code. Species distribution model results should be
                  easily accessible to decision makers, such as
                  through a web-based spatial decision support system
                  (SDSS).  With these principles in mind, we describe
                  our progress to date serving marine animal
                  biogeographic data from OBIS-SEAMAP
                  (http://seamap.env.duke.edu), and consuming the data
                  for predictive environmental modeling of
                  cetaceans. Using geospatial web services to automate
                  the scientific workflow process, marine mammal
                  observations from OBIS-SEAMAP are used to sample
                  through date-synchronous remotely sensed satellite
                  data for building multivariate habitat models using
                  a variety of statistical techniques (GLM, GAM, and
                  CART). We developed custom scientific workflows
                  using ESRI Model Builder, ArcGIS geoprocessor, R
                  statistical package, Python scripting language,
                  PostGIS geodatabase, and UMN MapServer. These model
                  outputs are then passed to an SDSS with spatial
                  summary capability.  Custom products will be
                  open-source and freely available. In the future, we
                  hope to integrate technologies such as OGC WCS,
                  OPeNDAP, and Kepler.  The principles and lessons
                  described here can be broadly applied to serving
                  biogeographic data, species distribution modeling,
                  and decision support within the ecological
                  informatics community.},

                  project is a cooperative effort of over sixty
                  institutions world-wide with the goal of
                  inventorying a majority of the world's estimated
                  160000 glaciers.  Each institution (called a
                  Regional Center, or RC) oversees the analysis of
                  satellite imagery for a particular region containing
                  glacier ice.  Data received by the GLIMS team at the
                  National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) in
                  Boulder, Colorado are ingested into a
                  spatially-enabled database (PostGIS) and made
                  available via a website featuring an interactive
                  map, and a Web-Mapping Service (WMS). The WMS, an
                  Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC)-compliant web
                  interface, makes GLIMS glacier data available to
                  other data servers.  The GLIMS Glacier Database is
                  accessible on the World Wide Web at
                  ``http://nsidc.org/glims/{''}. There, users can
                  browse custom maps, display various data layers,
                  query information within the GLIMS database, and
                  download query results in different GIS-compatible
                  formats. Map layers include glacier outlines,
                  footprints of ASTER satellite optical images
                  acquired over glaciers, and Regional Center
                  information. The glacier and ASTER footprint layers
                  may be queried for scalar attribute data, such as
                  analyst name and date of contribution for glacier
                  data, and acquisition time and browse imagery for
                  the ASTER footprint layer.  We present an example
                  analysis of change in Cordillera Blanca glaciers, as
                  determined by comparing data in the GLIMS Glacier
                  Database to historical data. Results show marked
                  changes in that system over the last 30 years, but
                  also point out the need for establishing clear
                  protocols for glacier monitoring from remote-sensing
                  data.},
